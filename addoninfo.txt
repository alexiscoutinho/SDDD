	addonDescription	"Special Delivery now with Death's Door features and Realism (optional).

The internal mode names for use in the console are sddd and rsddd.

These mutations were put together aiming to be as authentic as possible to the original ones. The only conflict is with the default items: although Death's Door uses dual pistols, the magnum from Special Delivery was chosen since it's the principal mutation.
